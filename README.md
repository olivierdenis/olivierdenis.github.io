# Entropic Information Theory

## Olivier Denis, 
## Paternity of Entropic Information Theory

Olivier Denis' research focuses on exploring the fundamental building blocks of universe i.e., quantum information, unifying concepts such as entropy, dark matter, black holes and wormholes under the Entropic Information Theory (EIT). 

EIT presents a novel perspective by positing that informational phenomena underlie fundamental aspects of the universe,  this Theory is able to explain complex physical phenomena as emergent from informational interactions.
