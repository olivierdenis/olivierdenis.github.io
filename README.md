Olivier Denis
Paternity of Entropic Information Theory

Olivier Denis' research focuses on exploring the fundamental building blocks of reality through quantum information, unifying concepts such as entropy, dark matter, and wormholes under the Entropic Information Theory (EIT). 

EIT presents a novel perspective by positing that informational phenomena underlie fundamental aspects of the universe, considered as the Theory of Everything to explain complex physical phenomena as emergent from informational interactions.
